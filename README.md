# Stock Portfolio Tracker

### This is a frontend web app I am currently building with Vue.js to allow the user to track their stocks. I plan to build this into a full-stack MEVN app.

## 1. Installation

_Clone this repo and run the following commands in your terminal._

```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

```
npm run build
```

## 2. Functionality

Currently, users can:

- View their stocks in a table on the home page
- Search their stocks in an autocomplete search bar

Full functionality will allow users to:

- Create a new portfolio by selecting stocks and entering the amount to invest in each one
- View their current portfolio, including the value of each stock and total value of the portfolio
- Receive alerts when there is a significant change in the stock market or in the value of their portfolio

## 3. Tools and Technologies

- Vue.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Cypress
